# Problems when building:

1. Development dependencies (packages)
2. Runtime versions
3. Equivalence of development environments (code sharing)
4. Equivalence of production environments(go to production)
5. Versions / compatibility(integration of other services e.g.: databases)

# Problems when distributing:

1. Different build generations
2. Access to production servers
3. Native vs. distributed execution
4. Serverless

# Problems when executing:

1. Application dependencies
2. Operating System Compatibility
3. Availability of external services
4. Hardware Resources

# Docker allows:

Build, distribute and run your code anywhere without worrying.
